# Challenge Explain Array Unique Element Count Extension

## Project Overview:
Sorting Arrays and Comparing the Elements- We first needed to sort these element in the array is very important when doing this challenge in order to become very efficient. After the arrays are sorted into different elements, we then compare them to make sure the values are in the same orientation as the current element, we then would compare and make sure the number the current element was unique.

## Sorting Arrays
The sorting of the arrays is done by using the ***let sorted =self.sorted(by: <)***. The function will sort the values from least to greatest and works with Ints and Strings.
